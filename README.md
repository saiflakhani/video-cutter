## :information_source: About

An simple application to cut your videos using ffmpeg.

## :interrobang: Reason

The first goal for this project was to learn more about the video header and the header info, especially MPEG-4. Also, I wanted to learn how to cut videos using only the binary file information (buffers and chunks).

If you read the [About][about] you already know that I was not successful, my initial strategy:

1. Learn about headers (MPEG-4)
2. Read the file (using [fs module][fs-module])
3. Cut some chunks
4. Recreate the file header
5. Join all chunks

Unfortunately, the information about `.mp4` file headers is not public and free, and I didn't want to spend a lot of time on this project (there are others I want to do), so I choose to use [FFmpeg][ffmpeg] and leave the first idea (the pseudo-code above) for the future.

[FFmpeg][ffmpeg] would basically do what I wanted to do on my own.

## :seedling: Minimum Requirements

- [NodeJS v12][node]
- [NPM v6][node]
- [FFmpeg v4][ffmpeg]

## :rocket: Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies

- [NodeJS][node-git]
- [Express][express]
- [Multer][multer]
- [FFmpeg][ffmpeg-git]
